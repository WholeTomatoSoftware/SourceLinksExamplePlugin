# Source Links Example Plugin
Source Links is a feature of Visual Assist that allows users to define links in source code comments.

Link definitions may use plugins provided with Visual Assist or created by third parties.

The solution in this repository creates a plugin that can be used as the basis for a custom plugin.

See comment at top of Plugin.cs for details.
